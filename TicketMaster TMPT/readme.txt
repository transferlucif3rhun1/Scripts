Steps before running the config:

1) Fill the apikey.txt with your NextCaptcha.com API Key, and then run Watchdog.exe.
2) Get sticky session/static proxies in large quantities(2000-5000), load that in OB2's proxy section and use them to run the config.
3) While running the config you will be asked to input a rotating proxy, input any rotating(rotates ip on each request/similar).
4) Also make sure in OB2's RL Settings, instead of TaskBased it's ParallelBased. In config's Job Settings don't tick either concurrent use of proxy or never ban proxy.
