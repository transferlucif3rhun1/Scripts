🔍 Kasada Reverse Engineering – Client Token (CT) &amp; CD Value Generation

## Description:
A detailed reverse-engineered analysis of Kasada’s bot mitigation techniques, focusing on the generation and validation of the Client Token (CT) and Token Key (CD) Value. This project aims to provide educational insights into modern anti-bot defenses, fingerprinting mechanisms, and cryptographic token generation.

📌 Key Topics Implemented:

    Token Structure & Generation: Understanding how ct and cd values are computed and validated.
    Fingerprinting & Obfuscation: Analysis of JavaScript-based fingerprinting and obfuscation techniques.
    Mitigation Bypass: Exploring potential security weaknesses in anti-bot defenses.
