Before Running the Config:
1. Start Watchdog: Run watchdog.exe and wait for it to automatically launch the other required executables.  
2. Adjust OB2 Settings: In OB2’s RL Settings section, set the Parallizer Type to ParallelBased (if not already configured).  

> Note: If Watchdog isn’t running, repeat step 1 before proceeding with the config.

Configuration Steps:
1. Obtain Session-Based Proxies: Ensure you have approximately 1000-2000 session-based proxies (these change IPs at intervals of 5-30 minutes, rather than with every request).  
2. Load Proxies into OB2:  
   - Add the session-based proxies to OB2’s proxy section.  
   - And When running the config, you’ll be prompted to enter a rotating proxy(could be same service or different does not matter).

Additional Tip:  
- If you're familiar with editing config settings, navigate to the Settings section and input your rotating proxy in the Answer area.
